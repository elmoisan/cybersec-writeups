# App - Script Challenges

This folder contains writeups for RootMe's **App - Script** category challenges, focusing on command-line scripting vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques.

## Challenges

| # | Challenge | Difficulty | Points | Status |
|---|-----------|------------|--------|--------|
| 01 | [Bash - System 1](./01-bash-system-1/README.md) | Very easy | 5 | ✓ |
| 02 | [sudo - weak configuration](./02-sudo-weak-configuration/README.md) | Very easy | 5 | ✓ |
| 03 | [Bash - System 2](./03-bash-system-2/README.md) | Very easy | 5 | ✓ |

## Key Concepts

- **PATH hijacking**: Manipulating the command search order to execute arbitrary code
- **Insecure `system()` calls**: Understanding the dangers of using `system()` without absolute paths
- **SUID exploitation**: Leveraging elevated privileges in vulnerable binaries
- **Shell scripting**: Creating and executing custom bash scripts for payload delivery

## Progress

- Completed: 3/3
- Total Points: 15
